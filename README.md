  * ## Design

    - ### Colour Scheme
      * The main colours used are a black and egg white color. These goes well together and the black color is mainly used as the background color for the navigation bar and footer. Egg white as backbround of the content parts. This scheme follows on all pages to create a similarity across the whole website. 

    - ### Typography
      * The Exo font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Exo has a nice feeling with a elegant design.

    - ### Imagery
      * A large background hero image to catch the user's attention. Gives a clear idea what this page is about. Across the whole website there is pictures to illustrate the products to potential customers.

    - ### Structure
      * The whole website is built to get the users easy access to what products the company offers and where the bakery is located. Therefore the website is neat with only the most relevant information present for the users. 

  * ## Wireframes
    - Desktop home Page Wireframe - [View](URL)
